When transferring files or making backups, be sure to create a hash of the file or files that you are operating on. This check ensures the integrity of the files you have been operating on are still intact once you are finished. There is built-in functionality to calculate and generate the hash value of MD5 without having to download and install additional program on most linux and unix based systems.<br><br>
Mac example:

	md5 file_to_hash.txt
	
md5 will then print out a single line after calculating the hash:  

* MD5(file_to_hash.txt)= bc0be71c056a7d7fad064fed72de46e1


Linux example:

	md5sum file_to_hash.txt
	
md5sum will then print out a single line after calculating the hash:  

* bc0be71c056a7d7fad064fed72de46e1 file_to_hash.txt
