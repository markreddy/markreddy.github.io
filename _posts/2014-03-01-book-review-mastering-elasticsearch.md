I’ve been working with Elasticsearch in production for over a year now. So when I picked up this book I thought it would serve as a nice reference book when I needed it, I also know the authors from the community therefore had an idea that it would be a well-written and detailed book. I wasn’t disappointed, some of the topics coved I had good knowledge on and are a good reference, however some topics such as Chapter 3: Low-level Index Control and Chapter 4: Index Distribution Architecture were new to me and I thoroughly enjoyed the introduction this book gave me. It also does a good job on expanding on some areas where documentation is lacking / non-existent, for example, Chapter 9: Developing ElasticSearch Plugins.<br><br>
The book takes a deep dive into the internals of Elasticsearch and Lucene with plenty of examples and source, for this reason I would consider this book useful for experts. However, beginners who wish to someday call themselves ES experts should also pick up this book and selectively choose their chapters as some are much more advanced than others.<br><br>
I enjoyed the book and would actively recommend it to anyone looking to get their hands dirt with Elasticsearch.
