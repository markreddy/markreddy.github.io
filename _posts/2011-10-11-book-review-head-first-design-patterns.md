Firstly I will say that despite this book leveraging the Java language for example code I believe it would be perfectly easy to follow for a non-Java engineer, since it is not too concern with specific syntax (maybe excluding the Iterator and Proxy patterns), just principles.  It’s very well written, engaging, easy to follow and straight forward. Design patterns themselves are really quite straight forward and very abstract.<br><br>
I found chapter one to be superb; however after that I found the approach and style too drawn out. They’re doing this because the methods they employ is supposed to help you remember the patterns better; but honestly I found myself wandering off mid chapter and wishing they’d just cut to the chase instead of going on about Suzy’s pizza factory, it started to feel like a Design Patterns for Dummies type book. Personally I used and found the book good, but I do prefer the more technical book. If you have trouble wrapping your head around a principle or remembering it this book would be useful.<br><br>
Simple test: Look up a design pattern tutorial or on Wikipedia (Strategy, Command, Observer, MVC, etc.) and if you don’t more or less get it after a good or two read then this is the book for you.
