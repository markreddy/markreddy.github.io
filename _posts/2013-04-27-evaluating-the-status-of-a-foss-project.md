Throughout my career I have worked with more open source projects than I care to remember. Some were good, some were great, some were poorly documented, and some were plain fun to use and some required stringent security analysis due to the application leveraging them. However the biggest concern of any developer incorporating a FOSS project into their codebase is the status of the project; is it too immature, buggy but on the road to stability with a thriving ecosystem of developers backing it or dead in the water. How does one evaluate this? Here are a few pointers that might indicate a project is not worth the risk.

* A project appears to be obviously inactive, having had no updates for years.
* A project that is obviously not going to be used in any new deployments because the standard language, library, or platform now has the capability built in
* A project that is rapidly losing developers to some more-trendy alternative project
* A project whose status is unclear, with some releases and statements in the forums that they are ‘definitely alive,’ but which seem to have lost direction or momentum.
* A project that has had no updates but is highly stable and does what is necessary, but is risky because they may not interoperate with future upgrades to other components.


I would like to expand on the last point a little, which is where the beauty of FOSS comes to light. Stable project but not longer maintained, this is not the ideal situation. However if it is crucial to your project, you have the choice to undertake the maintenance yourself. As your project changes and matures you will need to take the FOSS project along with it and see it more as something you extend, develop upon, tear apart and bandage up, rather than just another 3rd party library. The beauty of FOSS is that the possibilities are endless.
