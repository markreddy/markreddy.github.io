This was a book I bought as a reference guide or a read as needed book. I am comfortable with writing unit tests but there have been times when I was required to test Ajax functions, database access, etc. this is when this book proved its worth.<br><br>
What I found interesting and what keeps this book within reach my at all times is that it doesn’t just cover JUnit, it covers several testing techniques:
<br><br>
1)HTMLUnit and Selenium for testing front-end  
2)Cactus for testing the server-side business logic implemented with servlets/ejb  
3)DBUnit for testing data layer  
<br>
Its could have been called ‘Java Testing in Action’, however I find this as an advantage to the book while those looking for an in-depth look at the core of JUnit might be a little disappointed.
