I took and passed the DataStax Certified Cassandra Developer (DSCCD) exam a few weeks ago, that is offered by the company behind Cassandra, DataStax. It was a 90 minute exam in which I was required to answer 60 question, so 1.5 minutes per question, plenty of time. Personally I enjoyed taking the exam, it was nice to be evaluated on the various subject matter questions ranging from data modelling, CQL syntax, vnodes, partitioning and other internal workings of Cassandra. Once the exam was completed I was given my overall result and a breakdown of every subject covered by the exam. After taking the exam I was fully aware of the areas in which I was most competent and those areas that required some attention.<br><br>
