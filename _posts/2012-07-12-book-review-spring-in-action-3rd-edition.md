After working with Spring on a daily basis for over a year I felt myself learning the framework though repetition rather than understanding, hence I bought this book to give me the background to what I was doing, I wanted to know what happened when I declared beans, how I was able to inject them, etc., rather than just knowing the syntax and letting Duke handle the rest.<br><br>
I found this book and easy read with plenty of technical sections to get the brain working; I feel I have out grown of the spoon feeding books that use pizza or cat, dog, duck examples. With this book in hand it occupied my attention during my flight to and from Budapest and over most of my Christmas break. I was hooked after the first ‘ah-haaa’ moment and I began to understand what and why I was doing the things I was doing.<br><br>
On the down side, I was a little disappointed with the MVC chapter; I think it deserved to be covered in much more detail. I also feel that had I not been exposed to Spring previously I might have found this book a little too vague in places and somewhat rushed.
