In a recent post focusing on the use of NoSQL I mentioned the practice of scaling (horizontally). In this post I will briefly expand on the two types of scaling available.<br><br>
**Vertical scaling (scale up)**  
Vertical scaling, typically refers to adding more resources to a system in the form of addition of CPUs, memory and storage extend the machines capability. This form of scaling generally only employs one node (or instance).<br><br>
**Horizontal scaling (scale out)**  
Horizontal scaling, usually refers to clustering multiple independent nodes together to obtain aggregate computing power, that would often exceed traditional supercomputers. The scale-out model has created an increased demand for shared data storage with very high I/O performance, especially where processing of large amounts of data is required, such as in seismic analysis. This has fuelled the development of new storage technologies such as object storage devices.
